A few semesters and a degree later they decided it’d be better to just follow their dream and do what they always wanted to do instead and just draw. That’s how they landed their first participation in IDW’s team project Womanthology: Heroic. It was enough to make them fall in love with the art of making comics and they never looked back. Since then they’ve worked with people all over the world as a freelance illustrator and comic artist and their first personal graphic novel as an artist (with writer Paul Mallory), “Greta’s Grimoire, Book1: Initiations” was published in Greece by Jemma Press, followed by “Bestiary”. They’re currently working as a writer and artist on a love project “Equidistance”, a queer, multidimensional mystery/action story alongside co-writer and co-artist Dennis Yatras."

            "bio": "Dennis Yatras was born on the island of Zakynthos, and he’s been living in Athens for the past years. Growing up he was acquainted with Western and Japanese animation and games and became infatuated with their style ever since. As a hobby, he began doodling at a very young age and never seemed to break the habit. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in the Athens School of Graphic Arts in PA.D.A., honing his illustration and design skills. At the same time he decided to dive deeper in the anime and cosplay scene, the latter of which ended up leading him to a second BA degree in Middlesex University’s Fashion Design course some years later. Obsessed with the aesthetic of the 80’s and early 90’s pop culture, he loves designing characters that inhabit his strange yet familiar and nostalgic worlds. Lately he decided to follow his desire to complete Dark Practice, a spooky comic about a team of teenage witches' adventures in a small town of northern England. The first issue of his passion project made its debut at Comicdom CON Athens 2018. From then on he attended many other conventions in Greece and Europe. In 2019 he started to write and illustrate the graphic novel “Equidistance” along with his long-time friend Avgo. The four-parts of this new work are going to be published by Nerdula Creative Lab starting from the first third of 2021."
