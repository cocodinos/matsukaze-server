A half-blood, the son to a Syrian emir and a Byzantine noblewoman, Vassilios shows very little promise at a time when manhood is defined by the sheer ability to survive in a world full of violence: strength and skill in arms. </p><p>Yet, through a harrowing, mystical journey to the ends of the world and an internal battle between good and evil, Vassilios will defeat his greatest fears to transform into Digenes, an unstoppable warrior, and become leader of the Akrites, Byzantium’s celebrated border guards.</p>"

A few semesters and a degree later they decided it’d be better to just follow their dream and do what they always wanted to do instead and just draw. That’s how they landed their first participation in IDW’s team project Womanthology: Heroic. It was enough to make them fall in love with the art of making comics and they never looked back. Since then they’ve worked with people all over the world as a freelance illustrator and comic artist and their first personal graphic novel as an artist (with writer Paul Mallory), “Greta’s Grimoire, Book1: Initiations” was published in Greece by Jemma Press, followed by “Bestiary”. They’re currently working as a writer and artist on a love project “Equidistance”, a queer, multidimensional mystery/action story alongside co-writer and co-artist Dennis Yatras."

Growing up he was acquainted with Western and Japanese animation and games and became infatuated with their style ever since. He is a graduate of both Athens School of Graphic Arts in PA.D.A. as well as Middlesex University’s Fashion Design course. In 2017 he decided to follow his desire to complete Dark Practice, a spooky comic about a team of teenage witches. The first issue of his passion project made its debut on Comicdom CON Athens 2018. From then on he attended many other conventions in Greece and Europe. In 2019 he started to write and illustrate the graphic novel “Equidistance” along with his long-time friend Avgo. The four-parts of this new work are going to be published by Nerdula Creative Lab starting from the last quarter of 2021."
