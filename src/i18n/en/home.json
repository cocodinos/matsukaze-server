On Europe's eastern border with Saracen Syria, in the Byzantine Empire’s region of Cappadocia, a frail and bookish young man called Vassilios Musur is coming of age. A half-blood, the son to a Syrian emir and a Byzantine noblewoman, Vassilios shows very little promise at a time when manhood is defined by the sheer ability to survive in a world full of violence: strength and skill in arms. </p><p>Yet, through a harrowing, mystical journey to the ends of the world and an internal battle between good and evil, Vassilios will defeat his greatest fears to transform into Digenes, an unstoppable warrior, and become leader of the Akrites, Byzantium’s celebrated border guards.</p>"
