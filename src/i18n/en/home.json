      "detail": "The 10th Century AD. Europe is in deep decline. An entire continent mired in bloody conflict, superstition and pestilence is desperately trying to fend off the formidable armies of confident and thriving Islamic states. The fate of Europe's peoples hangs by a thread. \nIt is at this time that, on Europe's eastern border with Saracen Syria, in the Byzantine Empire’s region of Cappadocia, a frail and bookish young man called Vassilios Musur is coming of age. A half-blood, the son to a Syrian emir and a Byzantine noblewoman, Vassilios shows very little promise at a time when manhood is defined by the sheer ability to survive in a world full of violence: strength and skill in arms. Yet, through a harrowing, mystical journey to the ends of the world and an internal battle between good and evil, Vassilios will defeat his greatest fears to transform into Digenes, an unstoppable warrior, and become leader of the Akrites, Byzantium’s celebrated border guards. \nA retelling of the medieval epic of Digenes Akritas, the Two-Blood Border Lord, Digenes is a graphic novel about love, power and faith, set along the Silk Road of the Dark Ages."
